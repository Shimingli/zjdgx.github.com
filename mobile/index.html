		If you don't specify noGlobal then the globally exported moment will print a deprecation warning. From next major release you'll have to export it yourself if you want that behavior.

For version 2.5.x, in case you use other plugins that rely on Moment but are not AMD-compatible you may need to add wrapShim: true to your r.js config.

Note: To allow moment.js plugins to be loaded in requirejs environments, moment is created as a named module. Because of this, moment must be loaded exactly as as "moment", using paths to determine the directory. Requiring moment with a path like "vendor\moment" will return undefined.

Note: From version 2.9.0 moment exports itself as an anonymous module, so if you're using only the core (no locales / plugins), then you don't need config if you put it on a non-standard location.
